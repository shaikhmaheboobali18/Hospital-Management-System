# Hospital Management System in C

This project is a simple Hospital Management System built using C programming and Linked List data structure. It allows storing, updating, searching, and deleting patient records.

## Features
- Add new patient
- Display all patient records
- Search patient by ID
- Delete patient record
- Update patient information
- Uses Linked List for dynamic storage

## Technologies Used
- C programming language
- Linked List
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Basic file structure (optional to extend)

## How It Works
The program stores each patient as a node in a linked list. Each node contains:
- Patient ID
- Name
- Age
- Disease

Users can add, search, update, and delete records through a menu-driven interface.

## How to Run
1. Install any C compiler (GCC, MinGW, Clang).
2. Save the code in a file named `hospital.c`.
3. Compile the program:
